## :smile: Biography
I am a **machine learning researcher** who specifically working in the field of computer vision.  
My research interest is **algorithm foundation** and **real-world application** with machine learning and statistical pattern analysis. I've been so inside artificial intelligence, and learning more and more with working experience. My first work experience was at Cafe24 Corp. I developed computer vision-based web service solutions such as image inpainting, interactive segmentation, dominant color analysis, and landmark detection for E-commerce market. 

Currently, I am working on computer vision field with experience of autonomous navigation techniques at Avikus.
